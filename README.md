## 📝Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict which people are most likely to become customers of Arvato, a German company. It is based on an analysis of customer demographics compared to the demographic information of the general population in Germany.

The data used was provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and the information was worked out:

* Data preparation
* Unsupervised learning techniques:
  - Perform customer segmentation
  - Identify the parts of the population that best describe the company's customer base.
* Supervised learning techniques
  - Predict which individuals are most likely to become customers.

The above analysis will be used to predict which individuals will respond to the marketing campaign so that the company can target them rather than the entire population.
