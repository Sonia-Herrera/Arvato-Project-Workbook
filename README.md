## 🗒️Project Description
The Bertelsmann/Arvato project gives us the opportunity to find the relationship between the demographics of the customers of a mail order company in Germany and the demographic information of the general population, through data science. This challenge involves making use of unsupervised learning techniques, such as customer segmentation to find the characteristics that best describe the company's customer base. As well as the use of supervised learning to train a model capable of predicting which individuals are more likely to become customers of the company.

This project is based on real data provided by Arvato Financial Service and uses different tools and techniques for data processing, statistical analysis and predictive modeling to make strategic decisions.

The goal of the project is to predict whether individuals in the general population will become new customers.
In order to develop this project and achieve the objective, it will be carried out in 3 steps:
The pre-processing and dispute of data to know the data.
Unsupervised learning to perform a segmentation
Supervised learning to predict whether individuals in the general population are likely to become clients for Arvato Financial Services
